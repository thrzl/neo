and we back!

this one's rather short, just a quick update on finding things that bring me joy

for one, i bought a guitar 2 weeks ago and i've been learning pretty fast. i picked piano back up too. these two are things that i realized i do like the process of (esp guitar!)

i also started coding more, just working on random stuff. maybe ill publish some of it soon (on this note, have yall seen [msgspec](https://jcristharif.com/msgspec/)? its so awesome)

i've also picked up a LOTTTT of new anime and manga, esp romance stuff. my current watches:

## anime

1. **the fragrant flower blooms with dignity**<br/>
ðŸ¥¹ ts so beautiful bro

2. **dandadan**<br/>
if you can get past the weird stuff.... i love this show so much, evb is so fun and cute and funny

3. **my dress-up darling**<br/>
same situation as dandadan (the second season is much less freaky imo, but maybe i just got used to it)

## manga

1. **the fragrant flower blooms with dignity**<br/>
YES its so good im caught up with the manga AND watching the show

2. **the angel next door spoils me rotten**<br/>
the long title made me think it was gonna be stupid but it's much less stupid than i thought it was gonna be, its pretty good<br/><br/>
they have a spinoff one called *after the rain* that i lowk like more than the main one

3. **my dress-up darling**<br/>
i was so devastated the day i finished ts bro ðŸ˜­ i wish it was a million times longer than it actually is

4. **ordeal**<br/>
not a manga or romance but its so amazing and i really needed to include it<br/>
now that i think about it, i have a loonnnggg list of other webtoons i gotta read, so i'll probably get on that soon too
