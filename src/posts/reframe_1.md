i struggle a lot with self doubt and it's something that's been especially plaguing me recently. it influences my behavior in just about everything i do, and it's something that i'm working on.

i recently watched a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XEVn94dqvY) that mentioned <ins>reframing</ins>: listen to what you say about yourself, and remember that it's YOUR thoughts. what i think is based solely on opinion and there's little evidence, as i'm well loved and appreciated. for me in particular it's not even that i DO often fail at things, i definitely tend to succeed and excel at the things i try. i've noticed for myself that i often discount my achievements, and generally feel like *"if i can do it, anyone can."* it likely doesn't help that i'm a good teacher (this is the reframing at work </3) as it makes it seem even more that people can pick up all the things i do.

something else is that not much brings me joy. the school i'm at is known for having a horrific workload, and that weighs down on a lot of my time. so my biggest guess right now is that i just didn't have the time (it's been 5 years now) to actually explore my hobbies and interests, which is something i'm working on.

## my action items

1. [ ] **reorganize.** <br/>
 i'm setting up a PARA thing on notion to make sure that i can keep track of myself. what i can't see stresses me out a lot, so this should definitely help me stay on top of things so that i can have more time to do things i actually enjoy.<br/>
 if i come up with something good, i'll probably share it here. these people be getting on my nerves w/ everything being like $100 ðŸ˜­

2. [ ] **re-explore.** <br/>
find the things that used to bring me joy, and stick with them. an issue i have with keeping up with hobbies sometimes is that i don't enjoy the process of things as often as i enjoy the outcomes, so taking my time and exhibiting patience is definitely key here. i need to find something to put a lot of time into.

3. [ ] **reframe.** <br/>
i need to reshape my thoughts. i realize now that a lot of the way i think of myself is of little substance and isn't productive or helpful. to add to that, a lot of the biggest issues i have about myself are very solveable. instead of feeling some kind of way, i should just solve the problem. to be honest, just sitting in problems isn't something that's even common for me.
